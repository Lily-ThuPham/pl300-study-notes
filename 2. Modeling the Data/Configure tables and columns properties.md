## Table Properties

These settings apply to an entire table in your data model.

| Property         | Description & Purpose                                                                                                                | Best Practice / Use Case                                                                                                                                                                          |
| ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| General          |                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Description**  | Provides a text description for the table. This information appears as a tooltip when a user hovers over the table in the Data pane. | Add a clear, concise summary of the table's purpose, its source, or its refresh frequency. For example, "Contains all sales transactions from 2017 to 2020."                                      |
| **Row label**    | Defines which column best identifies a single row in the table (e.g., a product name).                                               | Set this for dimension tables. This property is used by the ==**Q&A visual**== and ==**Excel's Featured Tables**== feature to display a user-friendly name for each row.                          |
| **Key column**   | Specifies the column that contains a unique value for each row in the table (the primary key).                                       | Set this for dimension tables. Like the Row label, this is required for the **Excel Featured Tables** feature to work, as it needs a unique identifier for each row.                              |
| **Is hidden**    | Hides the entire table from the Report view.                                                                                         | Use this for tables that are not meant for direct reporting, such as intermediate tables used in Power Query, tables that only contain measures, or bridge tables used for complex relationships. |
| **Name**         | Enter the column name                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Description**  | A column description.                                                                                                                |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Synonyms**     | Add synonyms to make Q&A feature works better.                                                                                       | Prove other definitions for "Gender" column such as "Sex", "M/F", "Male/Female"                                                                                                                   |
| Advanced         |                                                                                                                                      |                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Storage mode** | Defines how the table's data is stored: Import, DirectQuery, or Dual.                                                                | This is an advanced setting. **Import** is the default and provides the best performance. Use **DirectQuery** for very large datasets or real-time data needs.                                    |
#### Table Storage mode
Tables in Power BI semantic models have different storage modes depending on the data source.

| **Table storage mode**                  | **When available**                                                                                                                                                                                                     | **Benefits**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Import                                  | Available in Power BI Desktop and Power BI web modeling using **Get data** (using Power Query) from almost all data sources.<br>Setting storage mode to Import is irreversible.                                        | Stores a snapshot of the data in a native storage for quick loading visuals in reports. Refresh the semantic model or table to get the latest data from the data source.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Direct Lake on OneLake                  | Available in Power BI Desktop and Power BI web modeling using **OneLake catalog** for Fabric data sources.<br>*Direct Lake on OneLake tables can be converted to import using semantic link labs in Fabric notebooks.* | Data is scanned from OneLake delta tables for quick loading visuals in reports. By default, latest data is loaded. Turn off auto-sync in the scheduled refresh settings page to access the latest data on refresh instead. Refresh is also called reframing for Direct Lake. Learn more about Direct Lake at [aka.ms/DirectLake](https://aka.ms/DirectLake). |
| Direct Lake on SQL                      | Available from **new semantic model** button in the SQL analytic endpoints of Fabric items.                                                                                                                            | Data is scanned from OneLake delta tables for quick loading in reports. If a view is used, SQL granular access enabled, or a Direct Lake guardrail reached, then data is accessed using DirectQuery storage mode.                                                                                                                                            |
| DirectQuery                             | Available in Power BI Desktop using the **Get data** (using Power Query) for some data sources, such as SQL databases.                                                                                                 | Data is queried from the data source when visuals load and not stored in the semantic model. The query is a translation from the Power BI DAX query used in visuals to the native query language of the data source, such as a SQL query.                                                                                                                    |
| DirectQuery on Power BI semantic models | Available in Power BI Desktop when connecting to a Power BI semantic model then selecting **make changes to this model** or when an import or DirectQuery table is already added.                                      | DAX queries from the new model run on the source model and can use measures from both. Some column properties on the remote model can be overridden in the new model. This customization includes format strings and display names. Use this storage mode when you need to make a small change to an existing semantic model for a specific report.          |
| Dual                                    | Available in Power BI Desktop when converting a DirectQuery table to import. A dialog shows with options to then convert the remaining DirectQuery tables to dual.                                                     | The relationships between DirectQuery and import tables are limited and dual can help keep them as regular relationships.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| Hybrid                                  | Available for incremental refresh scenarios on an import table. The latest partition of the table can be in DirectQuery to ensure the latest data is available between import refreshes.                               | Learn more about incremental refresh in the [incremental refresh overview](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/incremental-refresh-overview).                                                                                                                                                                                            |
#### Storage mode usage example 
|Table|Storage mode|
|---|---|
|Sales|DirectQuery|
|SurveyResponse|Import|
|Date|Dual|
|Customer|Dual|
|Geography|Dual|
- Power BI Desktop caches dimension tables, **`Date`**, **`Customer`**, and **`Geography`**, so load times of initial reports are fast when they retrieve slicer values to display.
- Power BI Desktop doesn't cache the **`Sales`** table. Power BI Desktop provides the following results by not caching this table:
    - Data-refresh times are improved, and memory consumption is reduced.
    - Report queries that are based on the **`Sales`** table run in **DirectQuery** mode. These queries might take longer but are closer to real time, because no caching latency is introduced.
- Report queries that are based on the **`SurveyResponse`** table are returned from the in-memory cache, and are therefore relatively fast.
## Column Properties
In **Model** view, these settings apply to a single, selected column. The categories to configure column properties include: **General, Formatting and Advanced**.

| Property                | Description & Purpose                                                                                                                     | Best Practice / Use Case                                                                                                                                                                           |
| ----------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Name**                | Enter the column name                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Description**         | A column description.                                                                                                                     |                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| **Synonyms**            | Add synonyms to make Q&A feature works better.                                                                                            | Prove other definitions for "Gender" column such as "Sex", "M/F", "Male/Female"                                                                                                                    |
| **Display folder**      | Organizes columns and measures into folders within the Data pane.                                                                         | Group related measures into folders like "Sales Measures" or "Time Intelligence" to keep your model tidy and easy for other report creators to navigate.                                           |
| **Is hidden**           | Hides the column from the Report view.                                                                                                    | Hide columns that are only needed for relationships, sorting, or calculations but shouldn't be used directly in visuals (e.g., ID columns, "Month Number" used for sorting).                       |
| **Data type**           | Sets the data type for the column (e.g., Whole Number, Decimal Number, Date, Text).                                                       | Ensure every column has the correct data type. This is crucial for accurate calculations and correct behavior in visuals.                                                                          |
| **Format**              | Controls the display format of the data (e.g., Currency, Percentage, Short Date).                                                         | For a sales amount column, set the format to **Currency**. For a birth date column, set it to **Short Date**. This ensures values are displayed correctly in visuals.                              |
| **Thousands separator** | Toggles the display of a thousands separator (e.g., a comma in 1,000,000).                                                                | **Turn this on** for any large numbers to improve readability.                                                                                                                                     |
| **Sort by column**      | Sorts the values in the current column based on the values in another column.                                                             | The classic example: Sort the `Month Name` column by the `Month Number` column to ensure months appear in chronological order (Jan, Feb, Mar...) instead of alphabetical order (Apr, Aug, Dec...). |
| **Data category**       | Classifies the data in a column to help Power BI visualize it more intelligently.                                                         | Set a `Country` column to the **Country/Region** category so that map visuals can render it correctly. Set a URL column to the **Image URL** category to display images in a table.                |
| **Summarize by**        | Defines the default aggregation that Power BI will use when the column is added to a visual (e.g., Sum, Average, Count, Don't summarize). | For numerical ID columns (like `ProductKey`), set this to **Don't summarize** to prevent Power BI from accidentally summing them up. For sales amounts, **Sum** is appropriate.                    |
