*A guide through the maze* 
# Challenges 
As data volume grows, Power BI reports can become slow and inefficient:
- Query lag 
- Slow loading times 
- Slow response times 
- Timeouts and errors 
**The causes of such problems:**
- Inefficient data models 
- Complex DAX Calculations 
- Inappropriate visuals 
- Report Layout (module 3 - Performance Tuning)
- Backend Infrastructure (module 3 - Performance Tuning)
**The solution:** Performance optimization in Power BI involves modifying data models, reports, and dashboards to improve their speed and efficiency.
## Minimize sematic models 
- Ensuring that the correct data types are used.
- Deleting unnecessary columns and rows.
- Avoiding repeated values.
- Replacing numeric columns with measures.
- Reducing cardinalities.
- Analyzing model metadata.
- Summarizing data where possible.
# Benefits of Performance Optimization 
- **Enhanced Speed and Efficiency:** Faster report loading and query execution.
- **Informed Decision-Making:** Timely access to data for better decision-making.
- **Improved User Experience:** Reduced frustration and increased productivity for users.
- **Resource Efficiency:** Optimized use of computing resources.
- **Timely Report Generation:** Regular reports delivered on time.
Optimization can improve speed, decision-making, user experience, resource efficiency, and report generation.
# Fundamental concept of Optimization 
## Definition 
Optimization in the context of Power BI is the processed of transforming, cleaning and organizing the datasets to achieve the best possible data performance.
Optimization technique involves: sorting, indexing to help manage data and search faster. 
## Tools for Optimization 
- Sorting
- Filtering 
- Indexing 
- Data transformation 
### 1. Sorting 
Make the dataset easier to interpret.
Better visual.
Faster and more efficient data processing.
Better identifying of trends, patterns, outliers 
### 2. Filtering 
Enhances clarity and relevant 
Eliminate unnecessary noise 
Reduce processing time by reducing data 
### 3.Index 
Quickly locate specific data 
Saves time 
Faster response 
### 4.Transformation 
Improve data consistency by standardizing (date, unit)
Eliminate errors 

# Optimization - Report performance tuning steps 
 1. Identify the problem areas 
 2. Optimize data queries 
 3. Streamline the data model 
 4. Improve visualizations 
 5. Use aggregations and summarization
 6. Caching and pre-loading data 
 7. Monitoring and iterating
