To improve performance, readability, and maintainability, it is a best practice to avoid using single, large, complex SQL queries. Instead, you should adopt a more modular approach.

---
### 1. Segment Datasets (Break SQL Statements into Multiple Sources)

Instead of writing one massive query that joins numerous tables, connect to each table (or a logical group of tables) as a separate query in Power Query.

- **Example:** For a report covering sales, customers, and products, create three distinct queries in Power BI: one for sales data, another for customer information, and a third for product details. Then, model the relationships between them in Power BI.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Improved Performance:** Smaller, simpler queries execute and refresh faster.
    - **Enhanced Maintainability:** It's easier to update or debug a single, isolated query without affecting the others.
    - **Simplified Troubleshooting:** Pinpointing errors is much faster in a small query than in a large, complex one.
### 2. Filter Data Early (At the Source)

Minimize the volume of data that Power BI needs to process by filtering it at the SQL source _before_ it gets loaded.

- **Example:** If you only need to analyze sales for the last quarter, modify your SQL query with a `WHERE` clause to extract _only_ that quarter's data, instead of loading several years' worth of data into Power BI and then filtering it.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Reduced Memory Overhead:** Less data is loaded into the model, saving resources.
    - **Improved Report Responsiveness:** With less data to process, visuals load and update more quickly.
### 3. Aggregate Data at the Source

If your analysis only requires summarized data, perform the aggregation at the SQL level before importing it into Power BI.

- **Example:** Instead of importing millions of individual transaction rows to calculate annual performance, write a SQL query that uses `GROUP BY` to summarize sales by year. This way, Power BI only needs to import one row per year.
- **Benefits:**
    - **Dramatically Reduced Data Volume:** Significantly less data is transferred and processed.
    - **Simplified Data Model:** The model in Power BI is simpler and smaller, leading to quicker report development and easier interpretation.
