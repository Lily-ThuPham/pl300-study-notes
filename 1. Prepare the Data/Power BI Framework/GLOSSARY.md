| **Data Model**              | A semantic model optimized for analytics; uses DAX (Power BI) and MDX (Paginated Reports) as analytic languages.                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Power BI Dataset**        | The data source for reports/dashboards; can include push, streaming, hybrid datasets or connections to AAS/SSAS models.                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **Analytic Query**          | A user-friendly query result that involves three steps: **Filter**, **Group**, and **Summarize** to produce meaningful insights.                                                                                                                                                          |
| → Filter                    | Set filters at report, page, or visual level (includes RLS). Slicers commonly used to filter visuals.                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| → Grouping                  | Divide data into categories for individual analysis.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| → Summarize                 | Apply aggregate functions like sum, count, min/max to produce a single value result.                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Tabular Model**           | A type of semantic model with tables of columns, relationships, hierarchies, and calculations. Not all semantic models are tabular.                                                                                                                                                       |
| **Star Schema Design**      | Uses **dimension tables** (entities) and **fact tables** (observations) with key columns and numeric measures. Dimensions filter/group, facts summarize.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Table Storage Mode**      | Determines where data is stored:  <br>**Import** (cached) — fast  <br>**DirectQuery** (live) — always current  <br>**Dual** — hybrid approach.                                                                                                                                            |
| **Model Framework**         | Three types based on table storage mode <br>**Import** – stored in Power BI  <br>**DirectQuery** – queried live  <br>**Composite** – uses multiple source groups for flexibility.                                                                                                         |
| **Data Source**             | The original place where Power BI gets data from. This could be a SQL database, Excel file, SharePoint list, or cloud-based service. For example, if you're connecting to your company’s customer database, that database is your data source.                                            |
| **Model Table**             | A table that lives inside Power BI after data is imported or connected. These tables are used in reports and dashboards to build visuals, create relationships, and calculate values. For example, a "Sales" or "Products" table in Power BI is a model table built from the data source. |
| **Source Group**            | A collection of model tables that come from the **same data source** and share the **same storage mode** (Import or DirectQuery). Power BI uses source groups to manage data connections more efficiently. For example, all DirectQuery tables from a SQL Server form one source group.   |
| **On-premises reporting**   | Power BI reports and dashboards **run entirely within a company’s own servers or local network**—not in the cloud, using **Power BI Report Server**, appropriate for organizations who prioritize security and privacy.                                                                   |
| **On-premises data source** | An **on-premises data source** is any database or file that lives inside your organization's local network or infrastructure.                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Data sovereignty**        | Data must stay physically or legally within a specific location—often **within the company network** or **within a country’s borders**.                                                                                                                                                   |
