# Common errors 
- Missing or null values
- Duplicate rows 
- Inconsistent data types 
If the errors are not identified, then their inclusion will lead to inaccurate, skewed, and inflated results. They can also give rise to extra, unnecessary storage and processing requirements.
# Missing or null values 
The inclusion of these values can lead to incorrect calculations, skew statistical results, or generate misleading insights.
# Duplicate rows 
Duplicate rows are instances in a dataset when two or more rows have identical values across all columns. This error often occurs because of data entry errors, glitches within the system, or data that’s been merged from multiple sources.
Such errors could also lead to unnecessary storage because your storage solutions need to host data that your projects don’t require.
It also causes inflation of the size of the dataset and could then lead to skewed results.
