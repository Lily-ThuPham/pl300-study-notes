##### 6.2 Data Transformation
This section of the exam typically emphasizes hands-on questions (hot area, drag-and-drop formats) aimed at solving data transformation challenges. Common scenarios include:
- Converting pivoted or transposed tables
- Cleaning and preparing data tables
- Minimizing data volume by lowering column cardinality
- Reducing data volume by eliminating unnecessary columns or rows
- Find top performing products/category/etc (using **Group by** and M code)
- Loading and transforming data from NoSQL sources (_JSON_ files)
- Combine files - [[Combine Files in Power Query]]
Solutions often require applying a sequence of Power Query transformation steps. Techniques may involve:
- Use first rows as Header/User Header as first rows
- Unpivot columns/ Unpivot other columns 
- Transpose columns 
- Pivot columns 
- Group by 
- Extract / Split column
- Remove/ Rename columns 
- Replace error / Replace values
- Keep Rows/ Remove Rows
- Merge Queries / Merge Queries as New  - [Merge queries overview - Power Query | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-query/merge-queries-overview)
- Append Queries / Append Queries as New 
- Trim/Clean columns: handle uncleaned text columns with leading/trailing space characters or clean texts with unreadable characters.
