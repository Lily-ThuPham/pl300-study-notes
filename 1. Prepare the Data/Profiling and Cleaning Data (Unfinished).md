## **1. Data type**
[Data types in Power BI Desktop - Power BI | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/desktop-data-types)
### Number types
- **Decimal number**: This data type can handle numbers with fractional values as well as whole numbers. The maximum precision (number of digits in a number after the decimal point) that the decimal number type can represent is 15 digits. The decimal separator can be anywhere in the number.
- **Fixed decimal number**: The decimal separator always has four digits to its right and allows for 19 digits of significance. This data type is useful in cases where rounding might introduce errors
- **Whole number**: This is an integer type that has no digits to the right of the decimal place. It has 19 digits of positive or negative whole numbers, such as -10, 0, and 103. Its range is between _-2^63+1 and 2^63-2._
### Date and Time types 
- **Date/time**: Represents both a date and a time value. Dates between the years 1900 and 9999 are supported. This data type is useful for keeping date and time data together. For example, a spreadsheet with Purchase Date or Order Date columns.
- **Date**: This data type represents just a date with no time portion. This data type is useful when you need only the date element of your records, such as birth date or contract date.
- **Time**: This represents just time data with no date portion. This data type is useful when you need only the time part of your dataset, such as an activity start hour or end hour.
- **Date/time/timezone**: This represents a UTC Date/Time with a time-zone offset. UTC, or Coordinated Universal Time, is the primary time standard by which the world regulates clocks and time.
- **Duration**: This data type represents the length of time. This data type is useful when measuring or calculating the time difference, such as Activity Duration or Sleep Time.
### Other data types 
- **Text**: This is a Unicode character data string. This can be strings, numbers, or dates represented in a text format. The maximum length of this data type can be 536,870,912 bytes. Or 268,435,456 Unicode characters. Unicode is an international character encoding standard that assigns a unique number to every character across languages and scripts.
- **True/false**: This is also known as Boolean data type, which has either a True or a False value.
- **Binary**: This represents any data with a binary format. For example, a non-human readable format is represented by ones and zeros. Binary files can contain diverse types of data. For instance, image or video files serve as binary files that are intended for computer systems to interpret.
### How Power BI infer data type from data source 
#### 1. Examination of data:
 Power BI Desktop examines the first 1000 rows of data for each column in the connected data source to understand the nature of the data.
#### 2. Default data type assignment
#### 3. Strict data sources: 
The connected data source is a standard database system or a spreadsheet with strict rules, there is usually little chance of errors or inconsistencies in the data type detection.
#### 4. Manual data entry:
CVS or Excel files
There may be more chances of errors or inconsistencies in data type detection.
BI's data type inference is not always perfect, especially when dealing with data sources that have inconsistent or ambiguous data.
### Updating data types 
Incorrect data types may prevent you from creating certain calculations, hierarchies, or relationships. It's important that you check and correct if necessary the column types in Power Query Editor before loading the data into the reporting environment.
### Change a data type
Left side of the column header, select the **data type** icon and then select the correct data type from the drop-down list.
Alternatively, in the **Transform** tab, select **Data Type** and then select the correct data type from the list.
To apply your changes to your data model: In the **Home tab**, select the **Close & Apply** menu. Then, choose the **Apply** or **Close & Apply** option to apply the changes

| **Column quality**      | Provides a quick, at-a-glance summary of the data integrity for one or more columns. It's the first step for a broad overview.       | **Displays three key metrics:** <br> • **Valid:** The percentage and count of values that are not errors and not empty. <br> • **Error:** The percentage and count of values that Power Query cannot process (e.g., text in a number column). <br> • **Empty:** The percentage and count of null or blank values. <br>                                                                                        | **Rapid Data Triage & Initial Assessment.** Use this to quickly scan your entire dataset after import. It immediately answers questions like: <br> • "Which columns have the most missing data?" <br> • "Are there any data type errors that need immediate fixing?" <br> • "Is this column reliable enough for analysis?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| **Column distribution** | Visualizes the uniqueness and frequency of the values within a column. It helps you understand the variety and pattern of your data. | **Provides two key counts and a chart:** <br> • **Distinct:** The count of all different values in the column (e.g., in `[Red, Red, Blue]`, the distinct count is 2). <br> • **Unique:** The count of values that appear **only once** in the column (e.g., in `[Red, Red, Blue]`, the unique count is 1). <br> • **Distribution Chart:** A simple bar chart showing the frequency of the most common values. | **Understanding Cardinality & Data Skew.** Use this to assess the nature of a column. It helps answer questions like: <br> • "Is this column a good candidate for a primary key?" (High number of unique values). <br> • "Is this a categorical column suitable for a slicer?" (Low number of distinct values). <br> • "Is the data heavily skewed towards a few values?"                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **Column profile**      | Offers the most detailed statistical analysis and value distribution for a **single, selected column**. This is your deep-dive tool. | **Provides two main panels:** <br> **1. Column Statistics:** <br> • Count, Error, Empty, Distinct, Unique <br> • Min, Max (for dates, numbers, and text) <br> • Average, Standard Deviation, Even, Odd (for number columns) <br> **2. Value Distribution:** <br> • A detailed bar chart showing the frequency of every single value in the column, not just the top ones. <br>                                | **In-Depth Investigation & Anomaly Detection.** Use this when you need to thoroughly investigate a specific column identified during your initial triage. It is crucial for: <br> • **Identifying Outliers:** Check the Min and Max values to spot unrealistic data (e.g., a negative 'Sales Amount' or a future 'Order Date'). <br> • **Validating Business Rules:** Does the 'Average' product price seem correct? Are there more 'Even' or 'Odd' numbers than expected? <br> • **Data Cleaning Strategy:** Viewing all distinct values helps you identify misspellings or inconsistencies (e.g., "USA", "U.S.A.", "United States"). |
> [! Notes] By default, Power Query examines the first 1000 rows of your data set. To change this, select the profiling status in the status bar and select **Column profiling based on entire data set**. 
#### "Column profile" feature
- **Filter by value**: interact with the value distribution chart on the right side and select any of the bars by hovering over the parts of the chart and Right-click to display a set of available transformations for that value.
- **Copy data**: select the ellipsis button (...) to display a **Copy** shortcut menu
- **Group by value**:  This feature groups the values in the chart by a set of available options (for example, text length). Select the ellipsis button (...) in the upper-right corner of the value distribution chart, select **Group by**
