Ensuring data is recent is critical for delivering accurate results. This note covers the data refresh features, dependencies, and best practices.

### 1. Understanding Refresh by Storage Mode
The refresh requirements for a semantic model are entirely dependent on its **storage mode**.

| **Storage Mode**       | **How it Accesses Data**                                                                         | **Is Data Refresh Needed?**                                                                                                                            |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Import** 📸          | Power BI copies data from the source and stores it in an in-memory cache.                        | ✅ **Yes (Essential)**. The model is a point-in-time copy. A data refresh is required to fetch changes from the underlying sources.                     |
| **DirectQuery** 📡     | Power BI sends queries directly to the underlying data source with every user interaction.       | ❌ **No**. The data is queried live and is always as current as the source. (Note: Dashboard tiles _do_ cache results, which refresh about every hour). |
| **Live Connection** 📺 | Connects to an external model (e.g., SSAS, AAS, or another Power BI dataset).                    | ❌ **No (in Power BI)**. The refresh is managed by the _external_ source model, not within Power BI.                                                    |
| **Push** 📨            | Does not connect to a data source. Data is pushed into the model via an external service or API. | ❌ **No**. The data is refreshed by the external process that pushes it.                                                                                |
**Key Details for Import Mode:**
- A refreshed model is either a **full refresh** or a **partial refresh** (using an incremental refresh policy).
- During a full refresh, Power BI keeps a copy of the existing model to handle user queries. This means a full refresh requires **twice the amount of memory** the semantic model normally occupies.
### 2. The Different Types of "Refresh" Operations
A "refresh" in Power BI can refer to several distinct processes. It's critical to understand the difference between a **data refresh** and a **schema refresh**.

| **Refresh Type**                 | **What it Does**                                                                                   | **Where it's Applied**     | **Key Notes**                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| -------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Data Refresh**                 | Fetches the latest data from the data source and loads it into the Import mode tables.             | Power BI Service & Desktop | This is the "main" refresh. In the service, this is what is automated by **Scheduled Refresh**.                                                                                                                               |
| **Schema Refresh**               | Updates the model's structure (e.g., adds new columns, detects renamed columns).                   | Power BI Desktop only      | A data refresh in the **service does NOT refresh the schema**. If a column is renamed at the source, the service refresh will fail. You must open the `.pbix` in Desktop, refresh it there to sync the schema, and republish. |
| **OneDrive Refresh**             | Synchronizes the `.pbix` or Excel file in the service with the source file in OneDrive/SharePoint. | Power BI Service           | This is a file sync, not a data refresh (though it can trigger one). It checks about **every hour**. It's based on file ID, so _copying_ a new file over the old one will break the refresh, but _replacing_ it is fine.      |
| **Tile Refresh**                 | Updates the visuals (tiles) pinned to a **dashboard**.                                             | Power BI Service           | Occurs automatically after a data refresh (for Import) or about every hour (for DirectQuery/Live Connection).                                                                                                                 |
| **Query Cache Refresh**          | Clears and rebuilds the query cache after a data refresh.                                          | Premium capacities only    | The cache stores query results to speed up report loading. It must be rebuilt after the underlying data changes.                                                                                                              |
| **Report Visuals Refresh**       | Forces the visuals on a report page to re-query the data model.                                    | Power BI Service & Desktop | Only relevant for **Live Connection** reports to clear the visual cache and get the latest data from the source model.                                                                                                        |
| **Automatic Page Refresh (APR)** | Automatically refreshes a report page at a defined interval.<br>[[Automatic Page Refresh (APR)]]   | DirectQuery sources only   | A feature set by the report author for monitoring scenarios.                                                                                                                                                                  |

|                                         | Refresh of report visuals                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            | Data refresh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | Schema refresh                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |

| What do the different refresh types do? | **Queries used to populate visuals are refreshed.**  <br>  <br>For visuals using DirectQuery tables, the visual will query to get the latest data from the data source.  <br>  <br>For visuals using imported tables, the visual will only query data already imported to the semantic model on the last data refresh.                                               | **Data is refreshed from the data source.**  <br>  <br>Doesn't apply to DirectQuery tables as they are at the visual level and rely on refresh of report visuals.  <br>  <br>For imported tables, the data is refreshed from the source.                                                                                      | **Any data source table structure change since previous refresh will show.**  <br>  <br>For example: To show a new column added to a Power BI Dataflow or SQL Database view.  <br>  <br>Applies to imported, DirectQuery, and Direct Lake tables.                                                                                                                                    |

| Keep in mind                            | For example, if you open a report in the browser, then the scheduled refresh performs a data refresh of the imported tables, the report visuals in the open browser won't update until a refresh of report visuals is initiated.                                                                                                                                     | Data refresh in the Power BI service will fail when the source column or table is renamed or removed. It fails because the Power BI service doesn't also include a schema refresh. To correct this error, a schema refresh needs to happen in Power BI Desktop and the semantic model needs to be republished to the service. | A renamed or removed column or table at the data source will be removed with a schema refresh, and it can break visuals and DAX expressions (measures, calculated columns, row-level security, etc.), as well as remove relationships that are dependent on those columns or tables.                                                                                                 |
### 3. Data Source Dependencies & Gateways
No refresh can succeed unless the Power BI service can access the data source.
- **Cloud Data Sources:** (e.g., Azure SQL DB, SharePoint Online)
    - **No gateway is required.** Power BI can connect directly.
    - Credentials are set in the dataset settings under **Data source credentials**.
- **On-Premises Data Sources:** (e.g., a SQL Server or file on a local network)
    - An **on-premises data gateway is mandatory** to act as a secure bridge.
    - An admin must add the data source definition (connection info, credentials) to the gateway
    - The dataset owner must be added as a **user** of that gateway data source.
    - The dataset owner must then **map** their dataset to the gateway in the dataset settings.
- **Mixed Sources (On-Premises + Cloud):**
    - If a single Power Query mashup query merges or appends data from an on-premises source and a cloud source, a **gateway is required for both**. The query for the cloud source will also be routed through the gateway.
    - To allow this, an admin must either add the cloud source to the gateway or check the box **"Allow user's cloud data sources to refresh through this gateway cluster."**
### 4. Configuring and Monitoring Refreshes
- **Scheduled Refresh:**
    - **Location:** Semantic model settings > **Refresh**.
    - **Frequency (Shared):** Max **8** refreshes per day.
    - **Frequency (Premium/PPU/Fabric):** Max **48** refreshes per day (and unlimited API refreshes).
    - **Time Limits:** Max **2 hours** per refresh on Shared; **5 hours** on Premium.
    - **Timing:** "Best effort," initiates within 15 minutes of the scheduled slot, but can be delayed up to 1 hour.
    - **Limit of Refresh failure**: after consecutive 4 failed refresh, the scheduled refresh will be disable. 
- **On-Demand Refresh:**
    - Triggered manually via **"Refresh now."**
    - Does **not** count toward the scheduled refresh limit.
![Refresh now](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/media/refresh-data/refresh-now.png)
- **Refresh History:**
    - Found in the dataset settings, this log shows the status (succeeded/failed) of past refreshes.
    - It is critical for troubleshooting, as it will show **multiple failed attempts** if Power BI retries a refresh.
    - It also breaks down the refresh into **Data** and **Query Cache** phases.
![Refresh history](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/power-bi/connect-data/media/refresh-data/refresh-history.png)
- **Fabric Monitoring Hub:** A new, centralized hub for monitoring refresh activities across all semantic models.
- **Failure Notifications:**
    - By default, an email is sent to the semantic model owner on failure. You can add other contacts to the notification list.
    - The schedule is **automatically deactivated** after **four consecutive failures** or after **two months of inactivity**.
### 5. Refresh Limitations
- **Dynamic Data Sources:** A refresh will fail if the connection info (e.g., server name, database, file path) is generated dynamically by another query. **However, refreshes _are_ supported if the query references Power Query parameters.**
- **Refresh Cancellation:** You can cancel a refresh in progress (for Import/Composite models) in Premium, PPU, or Fabric workspaces.7
### 6. Best Practices Summary
- Schedule refreshes for **less busy times** to avoid resource overload.8
- For large, slow-refreshing datasets, use **incremental refresh** instead of a full refresh.
- Optimize your model: only include tables and columns you actually need.
- Use separate gateways for Import and DirectQuery models to prevent scheduled refreshes from slowing down live reports.9
- Ensure **privacy settings** are manually re-applied in the service, as they do not publish from Desktop.
- Limit the number of visuals on dashboards, as a high number of tiles can increase refresh duration.

It uses the connection info _from_ the published semantic model to connect **directly to the original data sources** (e.g., SQL Server, Excel files) to get new data.                                                                                                                                      | **Yes,** if any of the _original data sources_ are on-premises (e.g., local SQL Server, a file on a network drive).                                                   |
